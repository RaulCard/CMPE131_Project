    [Instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
3. Navigate into the project folder
4. Install dependencies using npm

    ```npm install```
5. Run the express server

    ```node .```

6. Start the mongodb database

    ```mongod```

7. Open your browser to localhost:8000. You should see the website.

8.  (Optional) When you make changes to the clientside js files (any js files in the 'public' folder) , run the following command to rebundle the files. Then, refresh the page.

    ```npm run browserify```

    This step will change eventually, because you have to do it every time you change a js file.
